# HeartPark
Executive Summary
Business Overview
	Our company specializes in interactive websites and sustainable outdoor apparel and equipment, dedicated to creating eco-friendly and durable products for urban communities, inner cities, and parks. With a mission to broaden our market presence in urban areas, we prioritize sustainability, ensuring our offerings are affordable, stylish, and environmentally responsible. To connect with urban customers, we focus on streetwear that is both versatile and functional, crafted from recycled or sustainably sourced materials. By emphasizing accessibility and environmental stewardship, we aim to provide eco-conscious consumers with high-quality apparel that supports their active lifestyles while minimizing their carbon footprint. Additionally, we enhance the shopping experience by selling our clothing online through a digital platform. This platform not only recommends parks based on zip codes but also offers clothing suggestions informed by our weather forecasting partnership, creating a seamless and tailored experience for our customers.

Goals
	Our goal is to achieve a 25% increase in market presence in urban areas within the next three years (Coherent Insights). We will develop products that are grinder, circular, and energy-efficient through adherence to eco-design requirements. By 2026, we aim to ensure that 75% of our apparel is made from recycled or sustainably sourced materials (TheRoundup). The fashion industry is responsible for about 4% of total global greenhouse gas emissions ​(TheRoundup). Shifting to sustainable practices could potentially reduce these emissions significantly, with estimates suggesting a reduction of up to 63% by switching to renewable energy sources ​(TheRoundup)​(Coherent Insights). Implementing circular business models, such as clothing rental and resale, can significantly reduce waste and promote sustainability. For instance, extending the lifetime of clothing by just nine months can reduce the environmental footprint by 5-10% ​(Coherent Insights).

Competitive Advantage
	Our business will differentiate itself from competitors by prioritizing sustainability at every stage, using recycled and sustainably sourced materials to create durable and stylish outdoor apparel. We will focus on urban streetwear that resonates with city dwellers, combining functionality with contemporary design. Our digital platform will enhance the shopping experience by offering personalized park recommendations and clothing suggestions based on weather forecasts, fostering a deeper connection with our customers. Additionally, our commitment to community engagement and environmental stewardship will position us as a brand that genuinely cares about its impact, attracting eco-conscious consumers looking for both quality and responsibility.

HeartPark Website
    For the website, we utilized tools like Python, Flask, Pandas, OpenWeatherAPI, Folium, HTML, CSS, and OpenAI to develop the central hub of Heart Park that lets users partake in the "Heart Park lifestyle." In particular, we have integrated a system for the user to enter a ZIP code (07047, 07093) to get a view of the nearest parks around them. We have a page that displays some of our clothing items, and we partially implemented a "Park AI" component that recommends outfits with our products to the user based on location and weather data.
